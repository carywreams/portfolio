# Overview

My current, uncompensated efforts are focused on preparing an delivering a class on R through the meetup model. 
I belong to [The Lab](the-lab.ms) maker space in Plano, Texas, USA that offers its facilities to sponsored [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/TheLab-ms).


## Meetups

+ [R](meetups/r/) 
    +   [Essentials](meetups/r/essentials/)
    +   In Progress: Advanced Data Types
    +   In Progress: Data Visualization
    +   In Progress: Programming
    +   In Progress: Packages

## Pet Projects

I've wanted a place to store these for a while.
As I have the time to make them a little more presentable, they will appear here.
Most likely candidates at this point are experiments with MySQL and R, rmarkdown, tidyverse, etc.
The content here represents final product.
The raw materials used to create these pages may be seen using the button at the top of the page labeled, 'view on GitHub.'

+ [Nested Sets](experiments/ns) Implementation in MySQL 5.7
+ [Texas High School Enrollment Analysis](experiments/uil)
