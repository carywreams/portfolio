From the text:

| This book is designed for novices to R, both those with and without programming experience.

The author has also published a [video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0iUxoCEznfixaKofFkoOho26swycdAmy) based on his book.

##  Course Overview

### A Play in Five Parts

The text is divided into chapters.
The course is divided into five parts, each of which covers different chapters of the text.
The parts are identified below.
Please see each part's description for details regarding which chapters are covered.

1. [Essentials](essentials)
1. [Advanced Data Types](adt)
1. Data Visualization
1. Programming
1. Packages

### Course Preparation, All Sections

Participants should install R (and optionally R Studio) prior to the first meeting.
While this is not a course on using R Studio, many may find it far friendlier than the command line interface (CLI).
The free version of R Studio can improve the experience of using R.
The book's author has used R Studio in his accompanying video series.
The course leader prefers a keyboard to a mouse or track pad and so prefers the CLI.
Exposure to both methods will be thankfully unavoidable.
