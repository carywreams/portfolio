# Exercises, Chapter 6

+ TODO: Finish Exercises

## Exercise 6.1

+ text, p.32, 'The ```array``` function is a generalization of the ```matrix``` function.'
+ A _matrix_ is an _array_ whose third and final subscript has a value of one.
+ In my notes, I have the phrase "single layer" written next to this question.

## Exercise 6.2

```{r}
# x<-array()        create array, x, 
# seq(1:18)         populated with first 18 positive integers
# dim<-c(3,3,2)     with dimensions 3x3x2
#                   using default input convention
x<-array(seq(1:18),dim<-c(3,3,2))
x

# x[]   extract elements of x
# 2:3   include second and third rows
# -2    exclude second column
# 2     include second layer
x[2:3,-2,2]

```

## Exercise 6.3

```{r}
a<-array(seq(1:60),dim<-c(3,4,5))
a[c(1,3),-c(1,4),3:5]
a[-2,2:3,3:5]
```
