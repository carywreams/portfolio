__6.1__ True or False: A matrix is a special case of an array.

__6.2__ Write an R command that assigns the first 18 positive integers to the 3 x 3 x 2 array named _x_ using the default input convention.
Next, write an R command that extracts the elements of _x_ in a fashion that includes the second and third rows, excludes the second column, and includes the second layer.

__6.3__ The 3 x 4 x 5 array _a_ is filled with numeric values.
The R command 

```> b = a[c(1,3),-c(1,4),3:5]``` 

sets _b_ to a 2 x 2 x 3 array that includes the first and third rows, excludes the first and fourth columns, and includes the third, fourth, and fifth layers of _a_. 
Write an R command that accomplishes this same operation using the smallest number of keystrokes.
