# Exercises, Chapter 18

## Exercise 18.1

Use the ```help``` function to learn about the ```write.table``` function.
Use the ```write.table``` function to write the built-in data set ```Formaldehyde``` (which is a data frame) to an external file named "```file8``".

## Exercise 18.2

Create a file that contains the following two R commands:

```
SmallVector = c(1,2,6)
print(mean(SmallVector))
```

Then enter R and use the ```source``` function to execute the two commands.

## Exercise 18.3

Create a file that contains the data values: 1, 2, and 18.
The data values should be separated by _spaces_.
Then enter R and read these data values into a vector named ```x``` with the ```scan``` function.
Print the average of the three values.

## Exercise 18.4

Create a file that contains the data values: 1, 2, and 18.
The data values should be separated by _commas_.
Then enter R and read these data values into a vector named ```x``` with the ```read.csv``` (read comma seperated values) function.
Print the average of the three values.

## Exercise 18.5

Enter R and set the object ```y``` to 4 with the R command ```y = 4```.
Use the R ```dump``` function to save ```y``` to a file (you choose the filename).
Use the R ```rm``` function to remove the object named ```y``` with the command ```rm(y)```.
Type ```y``` to assure that the object no longer exists.
Finally, use the ```source``` function to recover the object named ```y``` and print its value.
