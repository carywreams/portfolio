__12.1__ Write a one-line function named ```oddjob``` with a single argument ```x``` that returns the elements in odd-numbered positions in the vector ```x```.

```{r}
# this is okay, but it doesn't use any of the cool new toys
oddjob = function(x) { return(x[seq(1,length(x),by=2)]) }
# this, however, uses a logical (true/false) element to indicate whether or not
# the element resting in that position should be returned
# see page 84, Section 12.2 in the text for a fuller explanation
oddjob_    = function(x) { return(x[  (1:length(x) %% 2 ) == TRUE ] ) }
# variations on the theme:
oddjob__   = function(x) { return(x[  (1:length(x) %% 2 ) != FALSE] ) }
oddjob___  = function(x) { return(x[!((1:length(x) %% 2 ) != TRUE )]) }
oddjob____ = function(x) { return(x[!((1:length(x) %% 2 ) == FALSE)]) }

x = 101:115
oddjob(x)
oddjob_(x)
oddjob__(x)
oddjob___(x)
oddjob____(x)
```
