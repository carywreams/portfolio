# Course Descriptions

These are short-hand descriptions used only for the Makerspace's Meetup submission form.

## Essentials

Essentials of R; six-week boot camp. Chapters 1-9 and 18 of "Learning Base R", by Lawrence M Leemis, ISBN 978-0-9829174-8-0. 
These six weeks will cover the basic data types of R, a subset of built-in functions, and conclude with an introduction to writing your own functions. 
Course will employ a flipped-classroom method: Prior to class, participants are expected to watch Dr. Leemis' YouTube video covering the relevant book chapters. 
Participants are highly encouraged to install R and R Studio prior to first session as bandwidth limits at The Lab could slow us down if everyone is downloading and installing simultaneously.
Participants are highly encouraged to purchase a copy of "Learning Base R."
The book is self-published which can sometimes lead to delays between order and shipment.
Exercises at the end of each chapter will be discussed and completed during our time together.
Additional short-courses are planned to cover the balance of the book: Advanced Data Types (Chapters 10-16), Data Visualization (Chapters 17, 19-21, 26), Programming (Chapters 23-25,27), and Packages (Chapter 28, tidyverse, rmarkdown, etc ).
